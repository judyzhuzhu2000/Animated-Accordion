                    <p>JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 during his time at Netscape Communications. It was
                    inspired by Java, Scheme and Self. ... So the Netscape/Sun partnership meant Sun acquired the use of
                    a competitive browser and a delivery system for their strategic technology.</p>

                    <p>In short, JavaScript became a hit because it turned web browsers into application platforms. Here's
                    how: JavaScript can be used in both the front-end and back-end of web development. ... Chrome, the
                    most used Internet browser in 2017, has been so successful in part because of its ability to process
                    JavaScript quickly</p>
